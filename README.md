## Hide YouTube Shorts with uBlock Origin  

### üõ† Introduction  
This project was developed with the support of [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/).  
Before starting, I was inspired by [gijsdev](https://github.com/gijsdev) and his project for hiding YouTube Shorts. However, since it seems that he has stopped updating it, I decided to create my own version to continue improving it.  

The goal of this project is to **hide or remove all Shorts videos on YouTube** effectively.
